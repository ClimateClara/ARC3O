Welcome to the documentation about the Arctic Observation Operator!
===================================================================

The Arctic Ocean Observation Operator (ARC3O) computes brightness temperatures at 6.9 GHz, 
vertical polarization, based on climate model output. More information about the motivation, 
structure and evaluation can be found in [Burgard et al., 2020a]_ and [Burgard et al., 2020b]_. 

Currently, it is customized for output of the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model but can be 
used for other models if the variable names are changed accordingly in the ARC3O functions.
