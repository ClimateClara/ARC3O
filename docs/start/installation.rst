How to install
==============

you can install it via pip

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install arc3o

or via conda


.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge arc3o

This package is programmed in python 3.6 and should be working with all `python
versions > 3.6`. Additional requirements are numpy, xarray, pandas, tqdm and pathos.

We recommend to install the dependencies via 

.. code-block:: bash
  
  conda install -c conda-forge pandas tqdm pathos 

as they might not work well using ``pip``.

If you want to work on the code, please fork this github repository: https://github.com/ClimateClara/arc3o/
