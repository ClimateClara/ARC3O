ARC3O
=====

This is the code for the Arctic Observation Operator for 6.9 GHz, presented in:

Burgard, C., Notz, D., Pedersen, L. T., and Tonboe, R. T.: The Arctic Ocean Observation Operator for 6.9 GHz (ARC3O) – Part 2: Development and evaluation, The Cryosphere, 14, 2387–2407, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2387-2020, 2020.

** ! Please be careful when using the code ! **

Especially, there might not be an error message when ran at another polarization or frequency than 6.9 GHz, vertical polarization,
but the results have only be evaluated at that frequency and polarization!

If you are interested in 6.9 GHz, vertical polarization, enjoy! :)

I am currently working on transforming this into a python and conda package and preparing a better structured documentation. 
In the meanwhile, use the Manual to get started. The example script and functions are tailored to be used with MPI-ESM data. If you use another climate model, I recommend checking and replacing the name of the variables and files of interest in the code.
